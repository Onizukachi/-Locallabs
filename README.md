This script reformats specific text, doing the following:

i) County Clerk/Recorder/DeKalb County becomes ‘DeKalb County clerk and recorder’
ii) Lowercase all words, unless they come after a slash or after a comma. (Details become clearer below in the following steps)
iii) Anything after a slash gets moved to the front of the name and remains capitalized. Example: "Alderman/Chicago" => "Chicago alderman".
iv) Anything after a comma gets put in parentheses. Example: "1st circuit judge, Circuit Court" becomes "1st circuit judge (Circuit Court)". Note: What stays in parentheses remains capitalized. *Everything else besides the exceptions I have already mentioned gets made lower case.*
v) "Twp" => "Township"
vi) "Hwy" => "Highway"
vii) "Highway highway" and "Hwy hwy" become "Highway"
viii) Delete any periods. So, "Something Township." becomes "something township" -- no period.
